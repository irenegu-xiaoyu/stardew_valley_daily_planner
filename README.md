 🌟 JUNIMO STRATEGY FOR TODAY

*Chirp chirp!* Welcome to your first day in Pelican Town, Master Yi! The sun is shining, the air is fresh, and your new life is just beginning. Even though the spirits are feeling a bit displeased today, there is plenty of work to do on the surface!

**Daily Tasks:**

1.  **Plant Your Gift:** Open the package in your house to find 15 **Parsnip Seeds**. Use your hoe to till 15 spots near your house, plant them, and water them immediately so they can start growing!
2.  **Seed Shopping at Pierre's:** Head to the General Store in town with your 500g. I recommend buying **Potatoes**, as they have a chance to provide multiple crops per harvest, which is great for early profit and farming experience!
3.  **Scavenge for Snacks:** Since your energy is low starting out, head south to the forest below your farm. Look for **Spring Onions** growing in the dirt near the sewer pipe—they are a free way to restore your energy so you can clear more land today!
