  🧠 THOUGHT: _Junimo squeak!_ Welcome to your first day in the valley, Master Yi! It's a beautiful sunny day to start your farm, even if the spirits are a bit grumpy today.

**Daily Tasks:**

1.  **Sow Your First Seeds:** Open the gift box in your house for 15 Parsnip Seeds. Clear a patch of land, hoe the soil, and plant them immediately. Don't forget to water them!
2.  **Investment at Pierre's:** Head to Pierre's General Store with your 500g. I recommend buying **10 Potato Seeds** (50g each). Potatoes have a 25% chance to provide extra crops upon harvest, making them excellent for early-game gold.
3.  **Forage for Energy:** Since your luck is low today (-0.093), stay away from the mines. Instead, head south to the Cindersap Forest (near Leah’s cabin) to look for **Spring Onions**. They are a free source of energy to help you clear more of your farm!
